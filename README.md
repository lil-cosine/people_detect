# people_detect.py

## Setup

### Libraries

All of the libraries used in this project are apart of Python's standard libraries and do not need to be preinstalled prior to running the program.

### Directory

This program needs to be placed in a directory containing a subdirectory titled "Taken_Images". While I would recommend that this program be stored in its own directory, it is not required for the program to execute.

### Setting up SMTP

Throughout the program, certain email addresses need to be stated in order for the SMTP library to work. These can be found in lines 25, 26, 45, 59, 60, and 81. In line 25, the SMS email attached to the target phone number should be written in place of "Receiving Email." In lines 26, 45, 59, 60, and 81, the email address of the account you plan on sending emails to should be written in place of "Sending Email." In lines 45 and 81, you will need to replace "App password" with the password generated by following this link: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en.

### Physical Installation

The only required part for the physical installation is a USB camera which is plugged into the RaspberryPi. While the project can be modified to use the RaspberryPi camera, it cannot in it's current state. 

## Execution

To execute this code using terminal, change into the directory the program is stored and type:
```shell
python3 people_detect.py
```
